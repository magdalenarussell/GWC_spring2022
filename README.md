# Fred Hutch Girls Who Code -- Spring 2022

This session we are exploring computational biology topics using Python.
We are providing the participants with a function that mutates a DNA sequence, and they will run the function and figure out what is happening on the DNA and protein levels.
We are also providing several plotting functions for participants to visualize simulated mutations.
